You are expected to implement a producer consumer relationship between two threads.
Both threads are running as long as the user types exit to the console.  
Producer thread should create (construct) a Job object and put it into shared arraylist. (And then create another one without waiting for the first one to be consumed.)
Consumer thread should take a single Job from the arraylist and then call job.consume(). That is the way to consume a job.

You should modify Main.java, Consumer.java and Producer.java. You should modify Consumer and Producer and turn them into threads that perform the above mentioned tasks.
While adding or removing and item from the queue, make sure that you do not run into ConcurrentModificationException.

BONUS: Once the user types 'exit' , stop threads gracefully.  

Hint: If you think that you should edit Job.java, that means you are on the wrong path.

Side information: 
The main thread creates three jobs and puts them into an arraylist.
That arraylist is used to construct Consumer and Producer objects, and it is the shared object that both threads should use carefully.
Main thread waits in a loop until the user types 'exit'.
